## Updates and Recommendations

### Backend Analysis
- **Main Script**: The `main.py` file expects `process_data` and `load_config` functions, but their definitions are missing. Ensure that the modules `module1` and `module2` contain the necessary functionality or provide these files.
- **Dependencies**: The project includes standard Python dependencies (`pyyaml`, `pytest`, `jupyter`) and uses `setuptools` for installation. Verify that all required dependencies are installed.

### Frontend Analysis
- The frontend files (e.g., `client/src/App.tsx`) appear to be set up for a React application with TypeScript. Ensure the `package.json` includes all required dependencies.

### General Recommendations
1. Include all necessary files for a complete project (e.g., missing function definitions).
2. Update documentation with specific instructions for running the backend and frontend components.
3. Ensure proper testing coverage, and include additional test cases in `tests/test_main.py`.
